In v.19.2 and higher, our LookUpEdit has the AutoSuggest mode: [SearchMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraEditors.Repository.RepositoryItemLookUpEdit.SearchMode). This mode allows you to run an asynchronous task in order to retrieve a list of records that match the user text. This list is then assigned to the editorâ€™s DataSource property. Please refer to this help article for more information: [AutoSuggest](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraEditors.LookUpEdit.AutoSuggest).
